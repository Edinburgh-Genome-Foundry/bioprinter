Bioprinter is a Python module to produce living art. It transforms an image into files that a liquid dispenser can use to *print* the image to a plate using pigmented yeast or bacteria.

Here are two examples of bio-art:

.. figure:: images/bioprint_dolly.jpeg
    :align: center

    Dolly drawn with baker yeast (white), violacein-producing yeast (black), and carotene-producing yeast (orange)


.. figure:: images/bioprint_england.jpeg
    :align: center

    England flag drawn with 3 different strains of the bacterium *E. coli*.


Bioprinter was written at the Edinburgh Genome Foundry by Zulko_ after an original idea and Matlab code by Mike Shen (`the project on Github <https://github.com/mshen5/BioPointillism>`_).

Bioprinter is released on Github_ under the MIT licence. Everyone is welcome to contribute.



Installation
--------------

If you have PIP installed: ::

    (sudo) pip install ez_setup bioprinter

Or unzip the source code in a directory and type in a terminal: ::

    sudo python setup.py install


Usage
--------

In the same folder as your code, place an image. It can have any resolution, but keep in mind that the width/height ratio of the plate it is printed on is 1.5. Make sure that a specific color is used to mark the un-pigmented background of the image, here we use blue:

.. figure:: images/dolly.jpeg
    :align: center

Then write the following code in `dolly.py`:
::
    from bioprinter import bioprint

    bioprint(
        image_filename="../docs/images/dolly.jpeg",
        output_filename="dolly.csv",
        bg_color=[0, 0, 255], # blue background represents empty wells
        pigments_wells={"A1": [0, 0, 0],  # black yeast in source well A1
                        "A2": [250, 120, 10],  # orange yeast in well A2
                        "A3": [255, 255, 255]},  # white yeast in well A3
        quantified_image_filename="dolly_preview.jpeg"
    )

Execute in a terminal with `python dolly.py`. This will produce a `dolly.csv` file as well as a preview image of the final printing (so that you can check if the image looks good at this low resolution).

.. figure:: images/dolly_preview.png
    :align: center

Prepare a source plate with the right pigmented yeasts in wells A1, A2, A3, use an agar plate as the destination plate, and feed `dolly.csv` to the Echo. Once the printing is finished, incubate 2 days at 30C (it would be one day at 37C for bacteria). Enjoy the result !
